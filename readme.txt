Provides a quick overview of installed WordPress plugins with their status, exportable as JSON.

== Description ==

**Modules Insight** is a simple WordPress plugin that lists all installed plugins, showing which are **active** and which are **inactive**. Ideal for developers and site managers needing a quick status overview.

MI adds a widget to your **Dashboard** and provides a shortcode `[plugin_list]` for displaying the plugin status list. It also allows **Administrators** to download the list as a `.json` report directly from the widget or shortcode output.

MI is completely read-only and does **not** make any changes to your site's plugin activation status.

=== ‚ú® Key Features ===

- üöß Pre-deployment or pre-update plugin checks
- üîí Identifying potentially unused plugins for cleanup
- üë• Sharing plugin status easily with your team or support

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `modules-insight` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly (Plugins > Add New).
2. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress.
3. Check your **Dashboard** for the "Modules Insight - Plugin List" widget.
4. Alternatively, use the shortcode `[plugin_list]` on any page or post to display the list.
5. Administrators will see a "Download List as JSON" button within the widget/shortcode output.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin make any changes to my site? =
No. MI is read-only. It does not activate, deactivate, install, or delete any plugins.

= Who can see the plugin list and download the JSON file? =
By default, the list and download button are visible only to users with the `activate_plugins` capability (typically Administrators). You can adjust capability checks in the code if needed for other roles, but be mindful of security implications.

= What format is the export file? =
The plugin exports data as a `.json` file, timestamped with the date of export (according to your site's timezone).

= Can I use this on a live/production site? =
Yes! MI is completely safe to use on live sites as it performs no write operations.
